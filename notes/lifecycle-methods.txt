            Lifecycle stages and their Methods (For class components only)

->  Mounting (EX: LifecycleA.js)

    lifecylcle methods belonging to this are called when an instance of component
    is being created and inserted into dom

    four methods (executed in order):
        1.constructor(props)
            -should be used to initialize state and bind event handlers (optional)
            -super(props) should be called first
            -DO NOT make ajax calls

        2.static getDerivedStateFromProps(props,state)
            -rarely used
            -used when state of component depends on changes in props over time
            -set state here from props (can't use 'this' keyword in static method)
            -DO NOT make ajax calls

        3.render()
            -required
            -read state and props and return jsx
            -do not change state or make ajax calls
            -children component lifecycle methods are also executed

        4.componentDidMount()

            -invoked once in whole life cycle of component
            -invoked immediately after a component and all of its children components have been 
                rendered to DOM
            -perfect place to cause side effects
            -Ex: load data using ajax calls or interact with DOM
    
    EX: LifecycleA.js & LifecycleB.js


->  Updating (Ex: LifecycleC.js)

    lifecylcle methods belonging to this are called when component is being re-rendered 
    as a result of changes in it's prop and state

    five methods (executed in order):
        1.static getDerivedStateFromProps(props,state)

            -method is called every time component is re-rendered

        2.shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps,nextState)
            -dictates whether component should re-render or not
            -performance optimisation
            -return value is boolean

        3.render()

            -returns jsx

        4.getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps,prevState)

            -called right before the changes in virtual DOM is refelected in DOM
            -takes previous props and previous state
            -capture some information from the DOM
            -method will return null or value that is passed as third parameter to next method

        5.componentDidUpdate(prevProps,prevState,snapshot)
            -called after the render is finished in re-render cycles
            -cause side effects
            -make ajax calls (based on new values)
        
    Ex: LifecycleC.js


->  Unmounting

    lifecylcle methods belonging to this are called when component is being removed 
    from the DOM

    one method:
        1.componentWillUnmount()

            -invoked immediately before a component is unmounted or destroyed
            -can be used to perform cleanup actions like
             cancelling network requests, removing event handlers, cancelling subscriptions
             and also invalidating timers 
            -do not call setState (as component will never be rendered)


->  Error handling

    lifecylcle methods belonging to this are called when there is an error during
    rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any child component

    two methods:
        1.static getDerivedStateFromError(error)
        2.componetDidCatch(error,info)

        will add later more on this
