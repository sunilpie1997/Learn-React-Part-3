Styling in React Components

->  Css stylesheets

    we can also set 'className' dynamically based on props.
    ex: StyleSheets.js

->  Inline styling

    ex: InlineStyle.js

->  Css Modules

    ex: App.js

    css modules once imported in any file cannot be used in any other Components
    where as basic Css stylesheets are applied to all other child components which may
    lead to css conflicts.

->  Css in JS Libraries (ex:styled Components)
