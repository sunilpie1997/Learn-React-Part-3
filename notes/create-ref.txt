Create Ref

->  we can access dom nodes directly
->  Ex: RefDemo.js

-> we can add ref to a class component as well
-> BUT KEEP IN MIND, IT IS FOR ONLY CLASS COMPONENTS
-> Ex: FocusInput.js (parent) and Input.js (Child)
-> In above, we will add ref to 'Input.js'



Forwarding Refs

->  we can directly access child component's dom elements using forward refs.

ex: ParentForwardRef.js (Parent) and ForwardRef.js (Child)
